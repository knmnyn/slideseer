4	Problem Formulation    A mass spectrum can be represented as a normalized vector b, where Σi bi = 1 and bi is the relative signal intensity at m/z value i.    The signature of an ion is a vector s, such that Σi si = 1, representing the distribution of its isotopes, i.e., si is the relative abundance of isotopes with m/z value i.    A signature library is a set of signatures S = { s1, s2, ...,  sn} where sj is the signature of chemical ion j.   If we arrange the n signatures in the signature library in order, the signature library can be represented as a matrix A = [s1, s2, ...,  sn], where the kth column in matrix A presents signature k. The labeling task consists of finding an n-dimensional vector x such that x[j] is the relative abundance of chemical ion j. Ax =b, x ≥ 0   To account for noise, measurement errors and calibration discrepancies define a distance function D and error bound E, then the solution space of spectrum b  is Lb = {a | D(Aa,b) < E and a ≥ 0}   The solution can be found using the LP model min Σi si  s.t (Aa - b)≤ s and (Aa - b)≤ -s  where a≥0,s ≥0 
5	Solution to the Problem The LP model has infinite number of solutions   We care about solutions which are significantly different   How to deal with continuous infinite space?? A threshold vector T = { t1, t2, ...,  td} divides each dimension of the search space into d ranges and the index vector I = { <l1, h1>, <l2 ,h2>, ...,<ln ,hn>}  The of SINGLE spectrum labeling reduces to subspace searching (Zheng Huang et al) 
6	Group Spectrum labeling A group of spectra that is collected at a single location over a short time-span is likely be similar. Given a group of spectra {bi} we can find a label set {Li} which consist of labels of the form {xi} each of length n  Define support(x)  =  |{Li | xi Є  Li }|/| Li | Group label : Given a group of spectra B = {bi} and a threshold Min Sup, x is a group label if the support of x w.r.t. B is greater than Min Sup. HOW TO SOLVE THIS??? MINING FREQUENT PATTERNS 
7	Method1: DFS Voting Algorithm Depth First Search(subspace S) 	if (¬is feasible(S)) 		RETURN 	else 		if (S is a cell) // cell corresponds to the finest granularity 			output the corresponding label of S 		else 			pick dimension(j) 			split S into a set of subspaces {Si} s.t. each Si is not divisible on 			dimension j 			for each result subspace Si 				Depth First Search(Si) 			end for   DFSVoting( Si,C’) C = {b|b Є C, S is feasible w.r.t. b} |C’|< Min_Sup*w DFSVoting(subspace S,set of spectra C) 
8	Method 2: Candidate Generation and Test GenTest L = {} B0 = {(1 − Min Sup) * w + 1 spectra randomly chosen from B} for each b in B0 	Find Fi, the label set of b 	L = L U Fi 	for each label l in Fi 		l.count++ for each spectrum b in B − B0 	for each l in L 		if l is a label for the b 		l.count++; for each label l in L if (l.count > Min Sup * w) output l as a solution group label 
9	Cost Analysis Estimate the effect of various inputs on the overall cost of the algorithm Study the characteristics of the data / input w.r.t to the algorithm Notations: CSingle Cost of labeling a single spectrum         CSingle = d*(n-1)*m CVoting Cost of DFSVoting algorithm CGenTest Cost of GenTest algorithm        CGenTest =   CSingle*(w − t + 1)+(t − 1) * m *((1 − s/w ) *(w − t + 1) + 1)        where t = w*Min_Sup
